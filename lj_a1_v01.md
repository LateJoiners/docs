### Part 1 - *What*

#### Project Name:
##### Late Joiners Sports Tipping App

#### Project Description:
A Web application that will allow users to sign up and place their predictions of the results of a variety of sporting tournaments, and track their success against other users.

Users will be able to select from a variety of upcoming matches, with the option not just to choose the outcome, but predict scores/results as well.

When the next round of a tournament begins, Users will receive a notification that the time has come for them to make their picks for the next round.

At the end of the tournament, the user (or users) with the best record can claim bragging rights for their prescience!

The application will be available to users across a variety of devices, from desktop browsers, to tablets and mobile devices.

##### Blair Fraser (s3641830@student.rmit.edu.au)
I have some prior experience with Java, Perl, PHP, Python (the latter of which I’m using occasionally in my current non-programming job to automate workloads). I enjoy programming in general, with a current preference towards backend development using dynamically typed languages (although I have not at this stage had much call to involve myself in frontend coding).

As well as the above languages, I have some experience working with RDBMSes, but am looking forward to getting experience with technologies I have not previously been exposed to (version control systems (specifically git), NoSQL and javascript frontend and backend frameworks (the MEAN stack).

Challenges during the project will be getting up to speed on these new (to me) technologies to the point that I am able to contribute as effectively as I want to.

Tasks that I would envisage myself working on are could be anything applicable to my level of skill at the time utilizing technologies belonging to the MEAN stack (frontend or backend-oriented tasks), leveraging my existing python knowledge to write a script to harvest data from APIs, transform it to the required format and write it to the mongoDB instance (though something like this wouldn’t be required at the extended functionality stage), helping generate and manage documentation.

#### Demonstrable Outcomes

##### Features
*describe the features that can be demonstrated*
*list 5 features and explain how we will validate it has been implemented*

##### Extended features
*features to be added if time permits*
*list at least 3 and explain how we will validate it has been implemented*

#### Project Motivation
*describe what motivated the group to choose this project*

- We felt it was a good opportunity to get exposure to a stack we wanted experience in.
- Provides a potentially handy portfolio item post-degree
- Was pertinent given the popularity of sporting results in modern culture

#### Project Justification
*explain how project scope fulfills below criteria*

##### Justified Workload
*develop project schedule*

##### Beyond Current Capabilities
*explain how it will extend current IT knowledge*

##### Project Risks
*list 3 project risks that would majorly interfere with project outcome*
1. API goes offline

*list 3 team dynamics related challenges that would delay project's progress*
1. Time difference of team members

*for each risk and challenge indicate how we propose to monitor and minimise the issue arising* [MG this sure sounds a lot like SEPM in 3rd year!]
