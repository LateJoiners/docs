### Project description clarity: 5

Project description outlines the high-level functionality the project will provide in clear and explicit terms. Some specific omitted (can a patient revise their logs after the fact if they realise something they have been experiencing for a time is in fact a symptom of their condition?), but nothing that rises to the level of detail that would be expected to be present in a high-level description like this.


### Worthwhile project: 5

Most group members have indicated limited programming experience, with no members other than Rolando having used programming outside of study units/high school studies. Building a web app providing the stated functionality will require a significant amount of learning and practical application and as such should prove challenging enough for them. Douglas and Casey's experience with SQL in a prior university unit will most likely assist them in how they think about data modelling, however their intended backend involves the use of a NoSQL database - learning to use this technology effectively enough to implement the project will require some additional effort. Timothy and Casey indicate some prior experience with HTML and CSS, however do not indicate any experience with Angular, and Rolando's frontend experience, while extensive, will most likely need to be augmented by some knowledge of the backend systems in place for this project to be successful.

On the whole, this project is indeed worthwhile in regards to it requiring the group members to expand their current skillsets.


### Team Resources: 5

Frameworks chosen are applicable to the specified project's intent, contemporary and (unquestionably) widely-used enough that researching any issues encountered during development shouldn't be an overly onerous task.


### Collaboration Strategy: 4

Collaborative workspaces provide a good range of group collaboration functionality. Communication expectations cover both synchronous (scheduled weekly hangouts meetings - both with and without mentor) and asynchronous (trello involvement) communication methods. No official expectation for communication during the week on any kind of text chat medium however, which may limit progress depending on the initiative of individual group members (although group appears to have been using the weekly trello cards for that purpose). Decision making process appears to be well considered.


### Execution Timeline: 4

High level project plan is detailed appears to be well thought out. Some tasks initially appeared to have not had enough time assigned to them (i.e. could two days be expected to be long enough for someone with primarily frontend involvement to configure a project skeleton including a backend component (firebase)?) - however from the progress on the trello board it would appear that the things are mostly on track. Team does not have individual trello columns for each week, which may make it harder to see at a glance what is required on a week by week basis.


### Completion potential: 5

From the trello artefacts (including linked screenshots) it appears the team is well on track to completing the project. The only point of concern is that "Agree on data structure for all project entities" (https://trello.com/c/NdJboJDE) has not been marked off as of 14/7, having had an initial due date of 1/7 (subsequently pushed back to 8/7). Having said that, it would be expected for data structures to evolve as the project progresses and the team stumbles across data structure requirements that they wouldn't necessarily have been able to envisage from the outset - a good argument could be made that with an agile methodology, a task like this shouldn't be placed at the start of the project in any case.


### Trello: 4

Trello columns/cards are mostly well organized and comprehensive, although it might be easier to get an idea of work required during a given week at a glance if there was an individual column for each week (although using such a structure it can be hard to know what to put in that week's column and what to keep in a separate, non-time-specific category). Also, while a specific study plan/log column is a good idea, only one team member has one set up at this stage. Limited activity from Braden apparent on trello board.
