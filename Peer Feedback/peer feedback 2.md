[Assignment 2](https://trello.com/c/VKPzAWwA/5-assignment-2-submission)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A great deal of effort has obviously been put into the formatting and layout, resulting in a document that seems to go well beyond the requirements in terms of professionsal presentation.

Though not stated as a requirement, (extremely) detailed descriptions are included along with mockups of each feature, effectively eliminating the possibility of potential misunderstanding. Mockup screens are detailed and well-designed - each appearing to serve their intended purpose well.

Justification of estimations has likewise been completed in a highly detailed manner, with a summary for each MVF describing trends in the estimations and explaining differences. Each team member appears to have approached their estimations as being either what time would be required if they were the sole person working on that particular MVF or if all members were contributing to all MVFs as opposed to what may be a more realistic breakdown of the workload where different members work on different MVFs (i.e. limiting the estimations to considering what the team as a whole would achieve). Having said as much, the assignment specification did not explicitly state how the estimations should consider the required tasks to have been divided up amongst team members, so there's no reason to consider this particular approach invalid per se.

Resources section (collaborative workspaces, software, tools and resources) is comprehensive both in terms of the number/range of tools/resources covered and the amount of detail in each. This section makes it quite clear to someone not already familiar with the project what technologies the team intend to leverage in order to achieve the project's goals, and, while the choice of a cloud-hosted database alongside a locally-hosted web server is somewhat curious, the tools/resources/software chosen would certainly allow the team to achieve their goals.

----------------------------------------------------

Done section could perhaps benefit from having due dates set for each item (even if there was no concrete "due by" date and the date is only added after the task is complete) - if done, this would allow someone to see at a glance when it was that these tasks were completed and gauge the team's rate of progress without having to open individual cards.

"Feature" cards could probably benefit from a (very concise) description of the feature being added to the card title to make it easier for someone not already familiar with the project to understand what is being worked on at a glance (although this is not a particularly huge concern as there is a "Minimum Features" section providing this information, and as this team has chosen not to create a separate section for each sprint/week, there are relatively few sections, meaning that the "Minimum Features" section will be either on-screen or only just off-screen most of the time when the board is viewed on moderate sized viewports (laptop fullscreen) and above.

On the whole, this team's trello board is quite well organized. Tasks card titles are descriptive for the most part, choice of sections to use is sensible/valid (although the argument could be made that the alternate approach of including a section for each sprint/week/arbitrary time period might have made the team's progress more clear at a glance to a viewer who is not already familiar with the project).

Each MVF is descibed in a highly detailed manner, with mockups showing various states of the app and the actions that trigger transitions between those states as well as the backend activity occuring by way of HTTP requests and JSON responses. However, some diagrams are too hard to follow in the PDF file itself due to size - it may have been better to either split the diagrams up, or to use a larger-than-A4 page sizing for the PDF file. Having said as much, the inclusion of links to copies of the diagrams on the mockflow website in these cases means that it is still possible to view the diagrams at full detail - even if one need to visit an external website in order to do so effectively.

In the lead-in to the estimation section an explanation is given of the approach to estimations (i.e. that they are based on how long each team member believed it would take them personally to complete the specified feature). While the assignment does not explicitly require this, it does give some much-needed context to the data that follows, and is a well-thought-out addition to the document.

While team members only provide textual justifications on an overall basis, rather than a per-feature basis, they nevertheless provide the relevant detail to explain the choices in assigning time to each phase (learning, research, design, code, testing) of each feature.

The software/tools/resources section is detailed and comprehensive, covering a set of software/services that could easily provide all required functionality for the team to achieve the project's' goals. Streamlined details and a simple description is provided for each of these resources, with more data supplied where the team has deemed necessary (i.e. with regards to git/github)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout of trello is mostly well thought out, with a overview of MVF/EVFs in a separate section, and backlog, work in progress and done sections. Having said that, looking at the "Backend API Additions" trello card makes me wonder whether it would be easier to follow if that card was turned into a separate 'API Backlog' section, and the existing backlog being renamed 'Non-API backlog', as doing so would both promote visibility of the work remaining in that category and simplify the task of keeping that particular backlog up to date.

The lack of dates on some of the trello cards in the done column makes it a little harder to follow the progress of the team, although cards in this column do seem to be more or less in order. An alternate approach where a separate section is created for each week/fortnight/arbitrary time period, and tasks are placed in the section when the team should start working on them and marked as completed once done (whether they are completed within the same time period as they are started or not) might make it easier for someone not familar to the project to get an quick overview of the team's progress at a glance.

One also has to wonder whether it might have been better to have a separate column "Team communication" or "Team issues" for the card "Communication with Andrew" (and any other similar cards) - although of course every team would hope to have so few issues like this as to not require many cards like that be added to their trello board.
