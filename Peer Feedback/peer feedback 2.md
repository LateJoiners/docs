##[Assignment 2](https://trello.com/c/VKPzAWwA/5-assignment-2-submission):

A great deal of effort has obviously been put into the formatting and layout, resulting in a document that seems to go well beyond the requirements in terms of professionsal presentation.

Though not stated as a requirement, (extremely) detailed descriptions are included along with mockups of each feature, effectively eliminating the possibility of potential misunderstanding. Mockup screens are detailed and well-designed - each appearing to serve their intended purpose well.

Justification of estimations has likewise been completed in a highly detailed manner, with a summary for each MVF describing trends in the estimations and explaining differences. Each team member appears to have approached their estimations as being either what time would be required if they were the sole person working on that particular MVF or if all members were contributing to all MVFs as opposed to what may be a more realistic breakdown of the workload where different members work on different MVFs (i.e. limiting themselves to considering what the team as a whole would achieve). Having said as much, the assignment specification did not explicitly state how the estimations should consider the required tasks to have been divided up amongst team members, so there's no reason to consider this particular approach invalid per se.

Done section could perhaps benefit from having due dates set for each item (even if there was no concrete "due by" date and the date is only added after the task is complete) - if done, this would allow someone to see at a glance when it was that these tasks were completed and gauge the team's rate of progress without having to open individual cards.

"Feature" cards could probably benefit from a (very concise) description of the feature being added to the card title to make it easier for someone not already familiar with the project to understand what is being worked on at a glance (although this is not a particularly huge concern as there is a "Minimum Features" section providing this information, and as this team has chosen not to create a separate section for each sprint/week, there are relatively few sections, meaning that the "Minimum Features" section will be either on-screen or only just off-screen most of the time when the board is viewed on moderate sized viewports (laptop fullscreen) and above.

On the whole, this team's trello board is quite well organized. Tasks card titles are descriptive for the most part, choice of sections to use is sensible/valid (although the argument could be made that the alternate approach of including a section for each sprint/week/arbitrary time period might have made the team's progress more clear at a glance to a viewer who is not already familiar with the project).

Each MVF is descibed in a highly detailed manner, with mockups showing various states of the app and the actions that trigger transitions between those states as well as the backend activity occuring by way of HTTP requests and JSON responses. However, some diagrams are too hard to follow in the PDF file itself due to size - it may have been better to either split the diagrams up, or to use a larger-than-A4 page sizing for the PDF file. Having said as much, the inclusion of links to copies of the diagrams on the mockflow website in these cases means that it is still possible to view the diagrams at full detail - even if it is not easy to do so inline.
