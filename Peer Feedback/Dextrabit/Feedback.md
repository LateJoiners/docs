### Project description clarity: 5

Description is concise and to the point, without being overly brief. Clearly indicates that the completed app will store both the initial image and actual data, and the actions that the user will be able to take with regards to the stored receipt images/receipt data.


### Worthwhile project: 5

As no team members have prior app development experience, completion of this project will involve at least some learning for each member. Some members will require Java primers before being able to effectively learn the app development process and tools. As such, each member can be expected to need to allocate at least five hours per week in getting up to speed and, once the implementation phase commences, completing implementation tasks for the project as a whole to be a success.


### Team Resources: 4

Team appears to have researched relevant tools (android studio) and learning courses for designing an android app with Java. However, as not all members were up to speed on Java, it has to be wondered whether use of a framework like adobe's phonegap or theappbuilder, which rely on HTML5 to build apps, might have allowed the team to get up to speed (to the point where they are ready to start implementation) quicker.


### Collaboration Strategy: 5

Communication expectations section is comprehensive and includes expectations re: asynchronous communication. Meeting agendas being developed and published prior to the meetings occurring will assist in ensuring that they are on track and productive. Decision making process is simple and sensible.


### Execution Timeline: 5

Timeline is highly detailed, and includes all deliverable artefacts. Time estimations appear reasonable for the most part and workloads for individuals in each given week also appear achievable.


### Completion potential: 4

Members appear to be all contributing, and should be able to deliver an app with working features by the due date. Having said that, with none of the members originally possessing app development experience, it is entirely possible the they will encounter issues that more experienced app developers would avoid, making it less likely that they will complete all EVFs.


### Trello: 5

Trello is well organized and comprehensive. It is easy to see individual member's tasks and their progress through them, as well as the team as a whole's todo list. It is fairly easy to see how they have progressed, although it did take me a while to find their assignment 1 submission with it listed in the 'Done' column rather than thte BITS progression column (not that an argument couldn't be made for it being present in either column).

### Other Comments:

Group appears to be well organized and making good progress.
