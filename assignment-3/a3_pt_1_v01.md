### Part 1

#### Project Background

##### Motivation
Right from the outset, ideas were thrown into the mix, via an **ideas** channel on our Slack team. These included potential options such as: a school math education app, grocery/shopping list app, medication schedule and records app, fantasy sports, etc. But the timing of the imminent World Cup provided the final inspiration for a 'sports tournament tipping' application where users could submit their predictions and measure the success or failure of their prescience against other users.

##### Aims and Goals
###### Aim

To create a functioning Web Application that allows users to compete in tournaments by submitting their predictions for the results of real-world sporting fixtures.

###### Goal #1
Create an application using a MEAN stack

Of the multiple stack's available for Web Application development, the Mongo-Express-Angular-Node stack is one of the more popular variants employed today. Mongo provides a (relatively) schema-less database that doesn't require team-members to be familiar or experienced with SQL. Instead it allows for beginner users to visually inspect database entries for validity and to become familiar with integration with a database. Node provides a Javascript back-end which is advantageous to team members who have at least some experience with this language, as opposed to other back-end languages such as Java, Python or PHP. It keeps the application contained within a single dialect. Angular is the powerful framework that provides tools for two-way data-binding and dynamic page creation that will allow our application to appear fluid and interactive. Altogether, this stack is both gentler on entry-level users, while providing the components necessary to deliver a fully-featured application.

###### Goal #2
Implement a responsive application styled with the Bootstrap framework

Bootstrap is a widely implemented and actively developed stylesheet framework which has the added benefit of providing very useful tools to develop responsive websites for multiple viewing platforms. As well as providing useful handlers for responsiveness, the existing stylings for interactive features such as buttons, tabs, navigation bars and the like, provide an out-of-the-box advantage when prototyping the site, right through to final deployment. Experience with Bootstrap would be valuable addition to each of the team member's CV's and this application provides a perfect scenario with which each team-member can gain valuable experience.

###### Goal #3
Implement a Continuous Integration (CI) build system which would test and validate code merged from each of the different team collaborators



##### Scope
- Responsive web application
- dynamic
- live data from APIs
- multiple, authenticated users

#### Project Progress

##### Description
Once our group was mostly formed, we began brainstorming ideas for what our web application would be based around. The idea to make our project a web app being the initiative of team leader Luke. After a short period discussing our preferences, the group had unanimously agreed on making a web app for tipping on the World Cup, given its popularity and relevance at the time. Shortly after this decision had been made however, we had realised that by the time our project was fully completed the World Cup would be well and truly over making our World Cup tipping web app to become redundant from the start. It was at this point where we decided to change our focus from the World Cup to a more general tipping web app. From this point, our project never drastically deviated from our aims.

##### Outcomes to Date
For our project, we have mockups of each web page that is accessible to the user of our tipping app.
This includes:

- A login screen, which also features a mockup for input validation when the user makes an error logging in.

- A reset password screen reached from the login screen, also coming with a mockup for input validation for when the user makes an error entering their email.

- An account page which features the users details, with a mockup of when a user decides to update their email.

- The page listing all sports with their leagues that are available to tip for.

- The page where users enter their tips, including a mockup for input validation where the user fails to enter a tip for 1 or more games.

- The results page where users can see the results from the previous week of their chosen league.

*insert outcomes of A3 part 2 here*

##### Scope Creep or Scope Contraction
The initial motivation for the application was a single sporting tournament, the World Cup. As we looked at comparable sites and investigated the plethora of applications with similar functionality, it became clear that the sustainability of such an application involved exposure to an audience wider than that of a single sport, let alone a single tournament of that sport (even if it is the largest quadrennial sporting tournament outside of the Olympics). Without extensive investigation we undertook to add multi-sport, multi-tournament capabilities to the functions of our application.

Out susceptibility to this was multi-fold. Early on, we were convinced, falsely or not, that there would be an *api-for-all*. This would provide us with endless possibilities as long as we kept our data models abstract enough. This soon proved to be harder than initially considered as most APIs were going to require a monetary subscription in order to maintain a stream of consistent and quality data with which to populate the application.

Additionally our limited experience; with only one member truly capable of authoring all components of the stack, plus the time-poor nature of study when combined with full-time work and other extra-curricular responsibilities (ie. family) meant that the time required to even develop and maintain the framework of the application was going to occupy almost exclusively the schedule for development, outside of the documentation requirements for assessment, let alone investigate, source and curate data sources for a multitude of sports and events.

##### Progress

##### Testing
Early on, during development of the stack and initial formation of the application, Luke initiated an automated build-testing system using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) which would be triggered upon commits pushed back to the hosted repository.(insert footnote to see below)

##### Tools and Technologies

###### The Stack

M-E-A-N

![angular](icons/mongodb_sml.png)

**[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com)** *the database*

Mongo is a free, open-source database, classified as a NoSQL database. It stores data using a JSON-styled schema, and this was one of the primary motivations for selecting this as our database for this application. The schema allows for easy inspection and validation, with a lower barrier-to-entry than some more robust, SQL-style databases. An additional advantage is the array of JavaScript frameworks that integrate with Mongo as well as an extensive and active developer community that is constantly refining and enhancing this product.

![angular](icons/express_js.png)**[Express](https://expressjs.com)** *the URL responder*

Speaking of which, ExpressJS is a Node module that manages route support; allowing for custom responses to specific URLs.

![angular](icons/angular_icon_sml.png)**[Angular](https://angular.io)** *the Web Application builder and engine*

Angular is the ground-up rewrite of AngularJS, the application framework originally developed at Google. In it's own words, Angular "combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop".

Angular is widely used, with additional bindings to companion frameworks (ie. Bootstrap) having been also developed and released. The use of components, along with two-way data binding facilitates the development of powerful, dynamic Web Applications, such as the one we are actively developing.

![angular](icons/node_js_sml.png)
**[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** *the back-end*

NodeJS is a run-time environment to facilitate execution of applications written in Javascript. It's designed to be event-driven and non-blocking, which makes it ideally suited to handling I/O requests.

It has been extended by one of the largest library of third-party modules, managed by its own package manager, NPM.

The key advantage of Node is it's written in Javascript; enabling the server-side code to be written in the same dialect as the front-end, and eliminating the need for experience with additional server-side languages such as Java, Python or PHP.


###### Additional Frameworks
![angular](icons/bootstrap_sml.png)**[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)** *the responsive styling framework*

Bootstrap is one of the most popular responsive styling frameworks; developed by Twitter and since released as an open-source project. It contains many templates to provide out-of-the-box styling for forms, buttons, tables, navigation and much more.

Bootstrap employs a grid system of rows and columns which makes relative sizing and formatting much simpler to define.


###### Support

// NOTE TO SELF: add ICONS in here

![angular](icons/git_sml.png)
**[git](https://git-scm.com)** *version control system*

git is the version control system (VCS) *de rigeur* these days. A couple of team members had moderately-extensive experience with git, prior to undertaking the unit, while others were relatively novice, or altogether unexperienced. It was immediately recognised that git could serve as a VCS, not just for our codebase, but also for all the documentation that was to be a requirement of the project. This would have the additional benefit of providing practical exposure to those team members with minimal experience as well as facilitating collaborative development via the use of cloned local repositories and branches.

All documentation for the project (including this one) was maintained under version control in a git repository.

![angular](icons/github_sml.png)**[github](https:///www.github.com)** *hosted git repository*

As git is to the development community, so github is to hosted git repositories. Github allows for easy server-side hosting of a git repository, with easy authentication (coupled with the free student accounts we are eligible for), it made for a de-centralised hosting service which provides reliable up-time.

On github, within our team, we hosted two repositories. One for the code of the application we are developing, and another for the documentation.

Team members managed the repository in several ways. Some users were comfortable enough to use the command-line interface (CLI), while others used third-party applications like [GitKracken](https://www.gitkraken.com).

Github accounts were also useful, in allowing us to integrate additional platforms without requiring additional account signups (see below for CircleCI).

Github also makes it easy to view contribution reports, with an extensive array or reporting and profiling, allowing easy access to the raw data of commits and contributions by the different team members.

**[circleci](https://www.circleci.com)** *automated testing host*

CircleCI is a development pipeline automation platform. It integrates with our VCS repository(s) and is configurable to perform a defined suite of builds and tests, with notifications for success or failure, along with deployment to our hosting platform(s).

Luke took time early on, to configure CircleCI for us in order to allow for *Continuous integration* of our application, with the aforementioned alerts for conflicts or failed builds tied into the notification system for our Slack Team via integration with the CircleCI application for Slack.

**[maid](https://github.com/egoist/maid)** *live testing script as documentation*

Maid is a Node module that allows the definition of a series of tasks to be performed, as a Markdown file! By using the Markdown syntax to distinguish between blocks of code to be executed, and common, descriptive text, a Maid file can operate both as an executable script and documentation at the same time!

![angular](icons/slack_sml.png)**[Slack](https://slack.com)** *real-time chat and collaboration platform*

Slack is one of the more powerful group collaboration tools currently in the market. It is available on multiple platforms, from Desktop to Browser, to mobile environments like iOS and Android. We decided on Slack for this purpose; it would allow team members to be accessible from multiple platforms, and by enabling notifications, hopefully would allow for communications without too much delay.

Slack allows for the creation of channels; topic-specific 'rooms' which allow us to segregate different elements of discussion throughout the course of development, without flooding a single, "main" channel. Slack adheres to the direct-notification convention, allowing a user to at ('@') another user in a public channel in order to attract their specific attention to a message.

The ability to directly communicate in privacy between users allows communications to be more focussed, allowing potentially sensitive discussion to conducted discretely, as well as also serving to keep main channels free of more direct chatter.

An added power with Slack is the extensive marketplace of integrations from common applications, including some already mentioned. We were able to extend Slack by integrating our Github repository and CircleCI project, to allow for notifications related to those two platforms to be published to our Slack team, as well as Google Hangouts integration in order to commence group chats.

**[trello](https://www.trello.com)** *collaborative project and task management system*

Trello is a task-tracking and management application, which was a compulsory requirement of the unit. Trello tracks tasks using a *virtual note card* system which allows specific tasks to be isolated to a single card, which are in turn collated with related tasks into user-defined groups, named *boards*.

Boards and Cards were used to assign team members to specific tasks, as well as being a place to publicly post links and media amongst the team.

Our team Trello board was used primarily as a means of tracking for our unit mentor, allowing them to view our own delegation of tasks, as well as adding their own in order to promote progress and development.

**[google hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com)** *group video-chat platform*

Google Hangouts was available to our team without effort due to the Google Suite backbone for RMIT email. Installing the hangouts [integration](link) with Slack, we were able to initiate hangouts directly from the Slack interface. A product of this process was to broadcast a notification to channel members of the hangout, with an easy link for members to click-to-join.

Google Hangouts were used throughout the development process for both our weekly mentor catchups, and our weekly team catchups. Using video conferencing helped build team cameraderie and familiarity, which was effective given our team were all strangers to each other at the beginning of the project.

**[heroku](https://www.heroku.com)** *backend hosting*

Heroku is a cloud-based platform that facilitates deployment and monitoring of Web Applications.

Luke configured a Dyno (a virtualised Linux container in Heroku parlance) that contained our Node.js server which could be spun-up on demand. Our application was light enough that we were able to take advantage of the free tier for our purposes, with no cost incurred.

Heroku features integration with CircleCI, allowing for swift deployment of successful builds to the Dyno.

**[netlify](https://www.netlify.com)** *client-side hosting*

Netlify is a web-hosting platform somewhat akin to github pages in that it can take deployment straight from a git repository. It hosts the client-side portion of our application.

#### Challenges and Learning

##### What's been easy?

It goes without saying, that this assignment has been a learning experience for each member of the team. We all entered this project with a variety of experience, both practically with respect to capabilities with the technologies involved, and academically; with the some members having a few units under their belt, and others being a few units shy of completion. Polling the team to reflect on the experience of producing this application has yielded some interesting retrospection.

Many found the Tools and Technologies employed to be either familiar enough, or with an easy enough barrier-to-entry. Working with a centralised Version Control System (VCS) for the documentation components of the assessment, as well as the codebase, provided a transparent and manageable approach to collaboration.

Conceiving the concept and potential of the application was also appreciably simple enough. Early enthusiasm certainly drove inspiration, and *on paper* the gestation and potential of the application was actively developed.


##### What's been difficult?
If conception and gestation was simple enough; development, when the time came, was where the project hit the skids. The proposed stack (MEAN) while initially met with enthusiasm for potential of practical experience with a new but prevalent collection of frameworks, was soon discovered to be a steep obstacle. For some, it was not just the stack, but the additional technologies of hosting-platforms, continuous integration and styling frameworks (Bootstrap) that added to the knowledge gap. Suddenly, what was easy enough to conceive in design, was proving more ominous to develop.

Some team members found their study patterns were not immediately coherent with group work. With the group attempting to adhere to a schedule involving *at least* weekly meetings via Hangouts, as well as the additional mentor meetings; adapting a study schedule, including both advance study of frameworks and technologies, as well as completing interim contributions to active assignments (ie. 1 and 2) meant a refactoring of study patterns that were already ingrained.

#### Project Processes
##### What's been learned about group projects?
The first thing we have learned about group projects is there needs to be a diverse range of individual personalities and skill levels in the group. A lack of differing backgrounds and opinions can lead to groupthink which is not helpful and even detrimental to the group project.

Also, time management and group deadlines for tasks for each active member are vital to keeping the group moving forward together towards a common goal. If even a single member fails to complete whats expected that was part of the group plan for a larger critical task, the project can become much harder than it needs to be.

We've learned that communication is essential to completing any groupwork. Regular meetings plus relevant updates from each member about what they are working on or completed lets everybody in the group know where the group is currently at in terms of progress, and if required lets the more experienced members of the group assist the junior members of the group learning if they are having trouble with a particular task or concept.

##### What were the group's processes for communication?

Regular scheduled checkups were mandatory for all group members so that the whole group will be on the same page and understand the short term and long term requirements individually, and for the group as a whole. Of course there will be times where group members will not be able to make it to group meetings, especially since a couple of members live in different time zones. So if this is the case it is required that those who cannot attend let the group know beforehand and also catch up with whats been discussed in the meeting afterwards via group communication and reading the meeting notes. Also, we used Slack for instant messaging or updates. If any member needed to contact a fellow member or the group as a whole, they were able to do that on Slack. Group members were also able to update the group on their progress on whatever tasks they were completing, or ask fellow group members for assistance in certain areas of their work they felt uncomfortable or not familiar with. With each member requiring notifications to be turned on, this method of communication for the group was an easy and fast way to keep the group up to date on most things regarding the project.

##### From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organizing a project of this nature?
The most important aspect of organizing this type of project is there needs to be a variety of individuals in your group, meaning differing personalities and skills, with differing skill levels. The variety in skill level ensures that there is no confusion as to each members role in the group. The more experienced members taking more senior leader roles, with the less experienced learning from them. With this type of project there will be tasks that require different skills, whether it be coding front-end or back-end, writing reports, creating mockup pages or experience leading groups. So having at least one member familiar with a certain topic, or familiar with the tools and technology required to complete a certain topic, is crucial to completing each task without hassle since they can either achieve whats required by the group themselves, or if the workload requires, teach the group how to accomplish the specific task.

##### What advice would you give...?

#### Marketing Pitch

#### Skills and Jobs

##### Write four position descriptions for people that you would employ to take your project to the next phase
Data Analyst:
To take our sports tipping app to the next phase, we will need something that will set us apart from other sports tipping apps out there. To get us to that point of uniqueness, we would require a data analyst who specializes in the area of sports statistics. Introducing a feature that would require his expertise such as a "tips and tricks" area for each specific game would give us a unique edge over most tipping applications. This feature would consist of important statistics for the two specific teams that would help the user make their decision tipping. For example, results from each teams last 5 matches, results from the last 5 matches these teams played each other, each teams predicted lineups, etc.

Marketing Manager:
Given that our application is in the arguably saturated market of sports tipping, we would need a way to market ourselves apart from the rest of the competition. This would require a marketing manager to continually help with exposure to the sports community and pitching ideas to further progress our tipping app so that it can remain competitive and unique.
