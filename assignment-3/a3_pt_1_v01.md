### Part 1

#### Project Background

##### Motivation
Right from the outset, ideas were thrown into the mix, via an **ideas** channel on our Slack team. These included potential options such as: a school math education app, grocery/shopping list app, medication schedule and records app, fantasy sports, etc. But the timing of the imminent World Cup provided the final inspiration for a 'sports tournament tipping' application where users could submit their predictions and measure the success or failure of their prescience against other users.

##### Aims and Goals
###### Aim

To create a functioning Web Application that allows users to compete in tournaments by submitting their predictions for the results of real-world sporting fixtures.

###### Goal #1
Create an application using a MEAN stack

Of the multiple stack's available for Web Application development, the Mongo-Express-Angular-Node stack is one of the more popular variants employed today. Mongo provides a (relatively) schema-less database that doesn't require team-members to be familiar or experienced with SQL. Instead it allows for beginner users to visually inspect database entries for validity and to become familiar with integration with a database. Node provides a Javascript back-end which is advantageous to team members who have at least some experience with this language, as opposed to other back-end languages such as Java, Python or PHP. It keeps the application contained within a single dialect. Angular is the powerful framework that provides tools for two-way data-binding and dynamic page creation that will allow our application to appear fluid and interactive. Altogether, this stack is both gentler on entry-level users, while providing the components necessary to deliver a fully-featured application.

###### Goal #2
Implement a responsive application styled with the Bootstrap framework

Bootstrap is a widely implemented and actively developed stylesheet framework which has the added benefit of providing very useful tools to develop responsive websites for multiple viewing platforms. As well as providing useful handlers for responsiveness, the existing stylings for interactive features such as buttons, tabs, navigation bars and the like, provide an out-of-the-box advantage when prototyping the site, right through to final deployment. Experience with Bootstrap would be valuable addition to each of the team member's CV's and this application provides a perfect scenario with which each team-member can gain valuable experience.

###### Goal #3
Implement a Continuous Integration (CI) build system which would test and validate code merged from each of the different team collaborators



##### Scope
- Responsive web application
- dynamic
- live data from APIs
- multiple, authenticated users
